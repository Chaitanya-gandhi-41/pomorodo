Pomodoro Clock
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a Pomodoro clock that helps users manage their time by
following the Pomodoro Technique: 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break.
This clock will allow users to customise work and break durations, track completed cycles, and
alert them when a session ends.
Project Scope
1. Frontend: Using React.js (TypeScript optional).
2. Timer Functionality: A countdown timer for work and break intervals.
3. Cycle Tracking: Track the number of completed Pomodoro cycles.
4. Customizable Intervals: Let users adjust the work and break durations.
Key Features and Requirements
1. Basic UI Structure
● Timer Display: Show a countdown timer in MM
format.
● Control Buttons: Start, Pause, and Reset buttons to control the timer.
● Session Label: Display “Work” or “Break” depending on the current timer session.
● Cycle Counter: Show the number of completed Pomodoro cycles (a cycle includes a
work session and a break).
2. Core Timer Functionality
● Countdown Timer: Start a countdown for 25 minutes by default for work sessions and 5
minutes for break sessions.
● Start/Pause: Allow the user to start and pause the timer.
● Auto-Switch: Automatically switch between work and break sessions when a session
ends.
● Reset Button: Reset the timer to the initial settings (25 minutes for work, 5 minutes for
break).
● Audio Alert: Play an audio alert at the end of each session to notify the user.
3. Customizable Intervals
● Adjustable Settings: Allow users to set custom durations for work and break sessions.
● Settings Validation: Validate inputs to ensure positive and reasonable time values.

4. Cycle Tracking and Completion
● Cycle Count: Track the number of completed cycles (one cycle includes one work and
one break session).
● Goal Indicator: Optionally, set a goal for the number of cycles (e.g., 4 cycles for a longer
break).
Optional Features (If Time Permits)
● Long Breaks: After a certain number of cycles, add a longer break option (e.g., 15
minutes).
● Progress Tracker: Display a simple progress bar showing the completion status of the
current session.
● Theme Toggle: Light and dark theme toggle for user preference.
● Notifications: Display a notification popup at the end of each session.
Constraints
● No External Libraries for Core Timer: Use native JavaScript setInterval for countdown
functionality.
● Timeline: 1-week deadline with a focus on core Pomodoro timer functionalities.
Technical Requirements
● Framework: React.js (TypeScript optional).
● Styling: Basic CSS for layout and timer visualization.
● State Management: Use React’s state for managing timer, intervals, and cycle count.
Deliverables
● Project Code: A complete code repository with comments and instructions.
● Deployment Link: Hosted on a platform (e.g., Vercel or Netlify).
● Documentation: A README file with instructions on using the Pomodoro clock and
customizing intervals.
